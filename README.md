# Marvel-Ultimate-war-2022


It is a two-player battle game set in the Marvel universe, where each player controls their own team of champions and engages in strategic combat on a 5x5 grid. The objective of the game is to defeat the opponent's team and emerge victorious.

One of the key aspects of the project was the development of an engaging graphical user interface (GUI) that provided an immersive gaming experience. Using Java and JavaFX, I designed and implemented the game's interface, ensuring that it was visually appealing and intuitive to navigate. The GUI allowed players to select their champions, view the game board, and execute their strategies effectively.
