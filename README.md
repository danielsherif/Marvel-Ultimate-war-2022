# Marvel-Ultimate-war-2022


The "MARVEL ULTIMATE WAR GAME" is an exciting two-player battle game set in the Marvel universe. You control your team of champions and fight against another player on a 5x5 grid. The goal is to defeat your opponent's team. The game has a user-friendly interface created with Java and JavaFX, allowing you to choose champions, navigate the game board, and plan your strategies. You can pick from a variety of Marvel characters, each with their own unique abilities. The gameplay is turn-based, requiring smart moves, powerful attacks, and clever use of special abilities. This project showcases my skills in Java programming and creating enjoyable gaming experiences.
